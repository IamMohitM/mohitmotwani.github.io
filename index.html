						<h1>Mohit Motwani</h1>
						<p>Welcome! I'm a passionate computer vision engineer from London. Previously I led the Computer
							Vision AI Development at a London-based
							pre-seed
							startup. With a deep appreciation for all things related to Computer Vision, Deep Learning,
							and
							MLOps, I invite you to explore a glimpse of my journey.</p>

						<h2>Brarista</h2>
						<h3>Computer Vision Engineer</h3>

						<p>After completing my Masters in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning, I became a
							part of Brarista. The journey has been truly remarkable. The opportunity to develop a
							CV-based solution alongside only two other CV engineers (including the CTO) has been
							incredibly fulfilling due
							to the strong sense of ownership and the weight of responsibilities involved.</p>
						<p>
							During my time at Brarista, I excelled in managing deep learning models using advanced
							technologies and developed a PyTorch-based library for streamlined model training. My work
							here improved product accuracy and played a pivotal role in maintaining the core software
							engine. I implemented distributed microservices for optimized resource utilization and
							designed scaling logic for fluctuating user traffic. It was a rewarding experience filled
							with impactful contributions.

						<h2>Ernst & Young</h2>
						<p>During my tenure in the Data Science Team of EY's Forensic and Integrity Services
							Department, I had the opportunity to contribute to a diverse array of projects with a focus
							on fraud detection for our clients. From delving into Computer Vision tasks such as Face
							Recognition and Expression Recognition, to applying Natural Language Processing techniques
							like Entity Extraction and Tone Detection, and even developing Web Applications for
							automating the extraction of unstructured data into structured formats, I was involved in a
							wide range of impactful work. My dedication and exceptional performance in client projects
							were acknowledged with the prestigious Kudos Award, recognizing my unwavering commitment and
							outstanding results.

						<h2>Axelta Systems</h2>
						<p>During my initial foray into the software engineering industry, I had the valuable
							opportunity to intern at Axelta Systems, an IoT company focused on services and education,
							located in
							Hyderabad. This experience allowed me to gain proficiency in visualizing real-time sensor
							data using d3.js and developing Android applications for real-time data visualization. It
							was during this internship that I first experienced a sense of accomplishment and the
							ability to contribute value to the world.</p>
